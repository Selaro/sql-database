<h1>Local SQL Employee Database Project</h1>
<h2>Project utilizing different types of queries all through VSCode using a MySQL extension.</h2>
<p>This project is my first SQL project meant to demonstrate the skills I learned from my independent learning throughout the last few weeks. I focused on learning the basics of SQL and decided the best way to demonstrate my knowledge would be to create my own database locally and insert my own data. From there I'd make some queries to manipulate the data to show what I know. The databases are linked to VSCode using a MySQL extension. I also included queries that say "Insert ALL" to insert all the information I have in my local database on your own system if you'd like to create your own.</p>
